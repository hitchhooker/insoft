    <p>
    The Implementing and Administering Cisco Solutions (CCNA) v1.0 course gives you 
    a broad range of fundamental knowledge for all IT careers. Through a combination of lecture, 
    hands-on labs, and self-study, you will learn how to install, operate, configure, 
    and verify basic IPv4 and IPv6 networks.
    </p>
    <p>
    The course covers configuring network components such as switches, routers, 
    and wireless LAN controllers; managing network devices; and identifying basic 
    security threats. The course also gives you a foundation in network programmability, 
    automation, and software-defined networking.

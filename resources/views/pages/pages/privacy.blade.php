            <h4>
                4 – To whom and why we transfer personal data
            </h4>

            <p>Privacy of personal data is one of the most important issues for us. We do not pass on this data to third
                parties unless necessary, and only the data required to comply with legal or accreditation requirements.
            </p>

            <p>We use third-party services that have limited access to your information for specific purposes, such as
                administration, analytics, optimization, advertising, marketing assistance, customer service, and data
                analysis.
                They assist us with our operations.</p>

            <p>
                Such third parties are authorized to use your information for these purposes only.
            </p>

            <p>If you decide, while using our Services, to use social sharing features such as “Share” or “Like” on
                Facebook or
                other third-party social network sites, this may allow the sharing and collection of personal and
                non-personal
                information both to and from such third-party social networks.
                You should visit the policies of such third parties for more information about their
                information-collection
                practices.</p>

            <p>We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies activities that we, in good faith, believe to
                be
                illegal. We will investigate or take action to counter illegal activity, suspected abuse or unauthorized
                use
                of
                the Services, or to protect the property or safety of others. We also may disclose your information if
                required
                by any law or court order worldwide, if the information relates to actual or threatened harmful conduct.
            </p>

            <p>In that case, we will consider applicable local laws, the nature of the order, as well as the legitimacy
                and
                proportionality of your information.</p>

            <p>In connection with any sale of our company or any line of business (including the assets relating
                thereto),
                customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In the event of any such sale
                or
                disposition of any or all of our business, your information may be transferred to the acquirer.</p>

            <h4>
                5 – Security and confidentiality of your personal information
            </h4>

            <p>We have implemented security measures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data
                security,
                and correctly use the personal information collected through the Services.</p>

            <p>We take, and force applicable third parties to take, reasonable precautions to protect your personal
                information
                against loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, and destruction.</p>

            <p>However, please remember that no transmission of data over the Internet or any wireless network can be
                guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot
                guarantee
                the
                security of your information and do not assume any responsibility for the unauthorized use of, or access
                to,
                your information that is under our control.</p>

            <p>When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information we take reasonable steps
                to
                require that they comply with this Privacy Policy and otherwise protect your personal information.</p>

            <p>If there is a breach of security involving your personal information from our Services, we will inform
                you
                immediately according to your local regulations relating to the notification of information Breaches,
                and
                take
                commercially reasonable steps to rectify such breach.</p>

            <p>If you believe your personal information is being improperly used by us or any third party, please
                immediately
                notify us via email at info@insoftservices.uk</p>

            <h4>
                6 – Your rights
            </h4>

            <p>We ask that you keep the information that you provide to us updated. You can correct any information you

            <p>You represent and warrant that all information you provide to us is true and correct, and relates to you

                to any other person.</p>

            <p>You can exercise your rights at any time and ask Insoft for access to, or rectification or erasure of,
                your
                information. According to your local regulations, if you are a European user, you can also request
                limitations
                to the processing of your personal information, object to the processing of your information, or
                exercise
                your
                right to data portability.</p>

            <p>Please note that other third parties (our data partners) may be controllers of your information. You can
                obtain
                more details and opt out of the sharing of your personal information to third parties for any purpose by
                contacting us via email at info@insoftservices.uk</p>

            <p>If you have previously consented to any direct marketing communication from us or subscribed to our
                newsletters,
                you can unsubscribe by clicking on a link available in each communication and newsletter we send you.
            </p>

            <p>Please note that the Services and features can be affected by your actions. Some of your information and
                its
                processing is mandatory for Insoft to provide the Services.</p>

            <p>Your actions can oblige Insoft to stop providing the Services. When the conditions below apply, the
                Services
                may
                be suspended:</p>

            <p>If you request limitations to processing that are mandatory for Insoft, or you object to such processing
                (in
                which case, we may not be able to provide you with the Services).
                If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information.
                If you withdraw your consent or ask for the deletion of your information, we will not use or process
                your
                information anymore but we will store it to answer regulatory or police requests. We also reserve the
                right
                to
                retain an archive of such information for a commercially reasonable time to ensure that its deletion
                does
                not
                affect the integrity of our data; and we further reserve the right to retain an anonymous version of
                such
                information.</p>

            <p>To preserve the confidentiality of your information, we must be sure to correctly identify you. For this
                reason,
                we may require you to provide us with a copy of an official document that can prove your identity. This
                copy
                will be safely destroyed within two months of your request being received and closed.</p>

            <p>Our team will look into your request and will answer you within one month, unless your request requires
                further
                investigation. You’ll be specifically informed if that is the case.</p>

            <p>We remind European users that they have a right to lodge a complaint with a European Data Protection
                Supervisor.</p>
